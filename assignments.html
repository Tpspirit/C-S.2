            <p>There were many choices how to handle the team web portfolio. After a few minutes of discussion, our decision was to use HTML & CSS to design our web portfolio. Actually, we could take advantage of some frameworks or existing library, however, in order to practice and everyone is able to contribute to the assignment, we decided to not use any framework but only HTML & CSS files. There are almost no obstacles as we have been already familiar to website creation. Requirements and contents are created by HTML, while CSS is used to display and animate how everything appears on our website. </p><br>
            <p>To make it online, we host the web portfolio on GitHub Pages. Collaboration is also available within this platform so all members could add or make changes at any time. GitHub offers no challenges when we update anything, thus, the assignment is always available to finish for everyone.  </p><br>

            <p>For demonstrating the layout of our application from both the user and developer perspectives we have utilized platforms such as TheyDo, Miro and Visual Paradigm.  
                TheyDo is a free “Journey Management”  platform which provides a variety of tools for simple yet very detailed journey mapping.  Miro is another simple platform which is primarily famous for it’s whiteboarding and that’s where we created our service blueprint. Visual Paradigm is a niche application/platform that has a vast amount of functions and is used for project management, we used it to quickly create our empathy map.

            <p>For designing application interfaces, our team settled on Figma. The variety of features and tools available can significantly speed up design process. With the use of font styles, color schemes, and other aspects, users can construct their own design systems. Figma enables team collaboration while simultaneously displaying what other team members are working on.  </p><br>

                        Tom, 25, a recent IT University graduate with an average income job.  He likes to shop but is not able to due to the fear of catching COVID. Tom is interested to know if there’s a way for him to try out different types of clothing and see how they look on his body without putting effort into going outside and taking every possible precautionary measure in order not to get sick. ​

Tom finds out about a store named “PULL & BEAR” which has an application that lets their customers to try out various clothing via a mobile application that projects AI generated images of said clothes onto the user by analyzing the input data of their body type and size measurements. ​

He is excited about this and is interested in downloading the said application onto his mobile phone. Tom opens the app store on his mobile phone and immediately finds it through the search bar, then proceeds to download it without a single issue. When he opens it, he is greeted by a prompt asking him to sign up and after sign in with his e-mail address. Tom gets to the home screen of the application and is asked to fill in his body measurements and personal info into a form, he heard about how this process goes previously and fills in the form without any issue. He then is sent to the global page of products he is recommended based on size and the store has in stock at the current moment. When Tom clicks onto a pair of jeans that seemed interesting, he is greeted by an info page which has details such as size, price, etc. But Tom also sees something new he has never seen before in an application like this, it’s a button that says he is able to try the current pair of jeans on right now! He clicks on the button in excitement and is asked to give the application permission to use his camera in real-time. Tom provides the mobile phone camera with all necessary permissions and is now able to see himself through the camera wearing the pair of jeans he was just looking at through the screen. He then tries on a jacket using this method but thinks it does not work with his body type, which then causes him to discard it into the bin of unsuitable products. Tom is quite happy with his selection of jeans though and proceeds to checkout where a prompt asks him to fill every necessary billing detail so he can pay and get them delivered to his home address.​

                        John is 55 year-old retired accountant living with his daughter. Conservative person without much interest in technology or the newest trends. He sometimes feels it stressful and tiring to go to the shop choosing clothes for himself and his daughter especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.​

                        John comes home from the shopping mall, and he feels it is so exhausted and dangerous to get in a crowd in this situation. His daughter recommends him the new feature in the mobile app that could help him to try the clothes on without go to any shopping mall ever. Even though a bit struggling at the beginning, he is finally able to install the Pull&Bear app with daughter's help. After signing up and signing in with his email, he gets in the home screen of the app. At first, he fills his body size details, personal info (weight, height, age) into the form of "Your details" section. Then, he finds the virtual fitting room feature attached to every product page that helps him to try the item on. After giving the app with using camera permission, he now can see the jeans he chose on his body surprisingly. He tries some more colorful T-shirts, but they seem do not fit him at all. Last, he discards all the T-shirts and drops the jeans into purchase basket. He finalizes the purchasing process by filling the delivery address into the app and paying for the item.
